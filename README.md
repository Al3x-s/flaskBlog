## Welcome to the Flask bin/hex App! This application encompasses everything I have been learning in terms of DevOps and applies it to create an amazing app. The app is not only developed using Flask, but it is also Dockerized and deployed. Additionally, I have set up a Continuous Integration pipeline to ensure smooth and efficient development.
# Features
- Flask-based: The app is built using Flask, a powerful and flexible web framework for Python.
- Dockerized: The app is containerized using Docker, enabling easy deployment and scalability.
- Continuous Integration: A robust CI pipeline is in place to ensure smooth development and testing workflows.
- Hosting: The app will be hosted, allowing users to access and interact with it online.
- Active: The app will be actively maintained and updated to provide the best user experience.
- No Tutorials, Only Skill: The Flask Blog App is developed solely based on my own skills and expertise. No tutorials or code copying involved, making it a true reflection of my abilities.
## Technologies Used
- Flask: A micro web framework written in Python.
- Docker: A platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- Continuous Integration: A process of automating the build, test, and deployment of software changes.
## Deployment
- The Flask app will be deployed using a cloud platform or hosting service to make it accessible to users. The deployment process ensures that the app is securely and reliably available for use.

## Continuous Integration Pipeline
- To ensure a smooth development process, a continuous integration pipeline is set up. This pipeline automates various tasks, such as code compilation, testing, and deployment. It helps catch issues early on and maintains a high level of code quality.

## Conclusion
- The Flask Blog App is an exciting project that combines my knowledge of DevOps with Flask development. By Dockerizing the app and setting up a CI pipeline, I have made it easier to deploy and maintain. Feel free to explore and interact with the app, as it is actively hosted and updated to provide a great user experience.
